'''
THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON MINI PROJECT. IT IS A GAME CALLED "PIG". I GOT THE IDEA FROM A YOUTUBE CHANNEL CALLED 'TECH WITH TIM',
ALTHOUGH I HAVE MODIFIED THE CODE TO MAKE THE GAME A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING!!

RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS:-

2 to 4 players can play the game at a time. They could bet on obtaining a specific number of points by rolling a die several times and 
adding up the number on the face. The one who gets the decided points or more at the earliest wins the game. 
BUT THE TWIST IS: EVERYTIME A PLAYER GETS A '1', THEIR TURN WILL BE OVER AND THE CURRENT SCORE DURING THE TURN WILL BE '0'!!

HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME ;)
