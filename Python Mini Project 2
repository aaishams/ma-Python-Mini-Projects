THIS IS MY SECOND PYTHON MINI PROJECT. IT IS A FUN STORY GENERATOR CALLED "MADLIBS GENERATOR". I GOT THE IDEA FROM A YOUTUBE CHANNEL 
CALLED 'TECH WITH TIM', ALTHOUGH I HAVE MODIFIED THE CODE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE FUN AND INTERESTING!!

RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS:-

Me to ChatGPT: I am making a madlibs generator in python. I am going to need a story where the user can give me some words. 
Can you give the story and for all of the words where the user needs to give them to me, make them like this <word>

I generated 3 stories using ChatGPT. The results are stored in the same folder as Story2.1.txt, Story2.2.txt and Story2.3.txt. 
More number of stories can be made and stored as text files in the same folder. The program chooses one of them randomly and asks
the user to fill the blanks denoted as <word> before even showing the story. Then, the program replaces the blanks with the words 
entered by the user to create and show fun and interesting stories. The user can save the output in a new file (output2.txt) 
if he/she wishes to.

MOST STORIES WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD :D

HOPE YOU ENJOY IT ;)
