Once upon a time, there was a SCARY HUMAN named WILL. WILL lived in a SCARY FOREST with their ONE PHONES. One day, WILL decided to go on an adventure to find the legendary HUMAN. Along the way, WILL met a SCARY DOG who offered to join them on their quest.

As they journeyed through the SCARY MOUNTAIN, they encountered many challenges. They had to cross a SCARY OCEAN and climb a SCARY WINDY. But WILL and their new friend persevered, fueled by HAPPY and determination.

Finally, after ONE days of travel, they reached the SCARY UPSIDE DOWN WORLD where the HUMAN was said to be hidden. With trembling hands, WILL reached out and grasped the HUMAN, feeling a surge of HAPPY.

With the HUMAN in hand, WILL and their companion returned home triumphantly. They were hailed as heroes and celebrated with a grand feast, recounting their epic journey for years to come.
