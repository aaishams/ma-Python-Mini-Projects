THIS IS MY THIRD PYTHON MINI PROJECT. IT IS A "TIMED MATH CHALLENGE". I GOT THE IDEA FROM A YOUTUBE CHANNEL CALLED 'TECH WITH TIM',
ALTHOUGH I HAVE MODIFIED THE CODE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE COMPETITIVE AND INTERESTING!!

RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS:-

The user can choose the lower and upper limits for generating the operands and the number of problems he/she would like to solve. The 
program generates random Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication problems for the user to answer with a maximum of 3 guesses per 
session. The next problem will be displayed only on solving the previous one. If the user uses all 3 guesses, the session will be over. 
The total session will be timed and on successfully completing a session, the total time taken will be displayed along with the 
number of problems solved. 

HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME ;)
